# OutRun
An homage to the original Sega classic called OutRun, released in 1986.

Built using JS, CSS and HTML, runs flawlessly on the browser, blazingly fast.

Could not have been possible without reading [Lou's Pseudo 3D Page](http://www.extentofthejam.com/pseudo/), a genuine pioneer.

Also massive thanks to the YT tutorials from whom I ~~essentially stole~~ took massive inspiration, and also was guided to Lou;s page.

(I forgot which tutorial for making an Outrun it was, if I find, will add)

### (needless trivia if someone likes to read)

Has my favourite track from the game, Passing Breeze.

Courtesy of Yakuza 0, also has Kiryu saying the game's name.

Its inspired from the more chillwave vibed OutRun (the original ofc) but is itself themed with the [OutRun/Synthwave aesthetic](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sca_esv=ccddce7db33695af&sxsrf=AHTn8zorDjf7JppGbvsXWJIBR1z3rypYTg:1739819652955&q=outrun+aesthetic&udm=2&fbs=ABzOT_CWdhQLP1FcmU5B0fn3xuWpA-dk4wpBWOGsoR7DG5zJBs5KbvfUChveCKqCmofFTOnfGzQ2XbHaUt9shq6uRI1WlUheeKjUJWiVAorcTcvJZyuC9xS8Zl6EngglXnwWzgR8905LcYGBL8yP0a47snSpMkkeExtxBV8snPsT-NC9xk-IUrui3Atv91FA2mHCXJysaPWcNA0x1xG7gtVm9vHoTFBsIA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjA1IyjtcuLAxVIk1YBHRkcDoYQtKgLegQIEBAB&biw=1920&bih=965&dpr=1) which of course is a wordplay on the name.

Thanks if you've read so far. Hopefully the game's hosted and stays that way.

But eitherways, check out [Lou's Pseudo 3D Page](http://www.extentofthejam.com/pseudo/) for a REALLY COOL piece of Internet history.
